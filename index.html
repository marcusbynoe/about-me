  <h2> Biography</h2>

  <p id="p1">Hey there my name is Marcus Bynoe! I was born in Virginia, but since my father was in the military I grew up around the country. Though, I did spend a great portion of my life growing up in Colorado Springs, CO and Oahu, HI. So I consider Colorado and Hawai'i my "home" states. I currently live in Colorado, but plan on moving to Washington and then back to Hawai'i eventually. My main goal right now is to make a career transition into tech. I've always loved computers and technology, especially after I built my first gaming desktop in 2011 as a teenager. I feel that being a software developer will provide many challenging and exciting opportunities. Which in turn, will help me achieve a better quality of life in the end.</p>
