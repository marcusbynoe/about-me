  <h2> Biography</h2>

  <p id="p1">Hey there my name is Marcus Bynoe! I was born in Virginia, but since my father was in the military I grew up around the country. Though, I did spend a great portion of my life growing up in Colorado Springs, CO and Oahu, HI. So I consider Colorado and Hawai'i my "home" states. My education history is a little bit all over the place. I finished my high school years in Hawai'i and started college at Leeward Community College. After a year I decided to drop out as I did not know what I wanted to do. After a 4 year stint in the U.S Army I moved to Colorado and enrolled at Metro State University of Denver. After two semesters there, I transferred to Community College of Aurora as the university style was a bit overwhelming for me. At CCA, I was studying for my degree in cybersecurity until the pandemic happened in 2020. Since then, I've put my education on hold up until enrolling in Code Fellows.</p>

  <p id="p2">My job experience is mainly centered around logistics. In the Army, I was a transportation management coordinator for 4 years. After that I was a transportation coordinator for Iron Mountain; a shredding company. After that I was a logistics specialist for an aerospace company called Sierra Nevada Corporation. After spending a year there, I moved back to Hawai'i to spend some time on the islands again. From there I was a janitor at the Hawai'i State Hospital (which was a psychiatric hospital for court ordered individuals) and then a TSA officer on the island of Maui.</p>

  <p id="p3">My main goal right now is to make a career transition into tech. I've always loved computers and technology, especially after I built my first gaming desktop in 2011 as a teenager. I feel that being a software developer will provide many challenging and exciting opportunities. Which in turn, will help me achieve a better quality of life in the end.</p>
